# Logic gate network

This is a simple logic gate network implementation in python.
It let's users create logic gates and connect them together to create a network and feed forward data through it.

## Requirements

The project was developed using `python 3.10.9`. It should work with any python 3 version.
But it is not tested. This project also needs `numpy` to run.
